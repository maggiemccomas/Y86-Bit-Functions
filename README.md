# Y86-Bit-Functions
Programs in C and Y86 that compute various bit and math functions. These include negation, factorial, square, and multiplication. The multiplication and factorial functions are implemented recursively. In addition, for the C program only addition, subtraction, and bitwise conjunction will be used in order to mimic Y86 more closely.
